# Ship's Backpack
A simple and clean backpack mod for 1.16.5, inspired from the abandoned mod "Adventure Backpack".


As a part of the series "Let's rework abandoned Minecraft mods found around the web", Ship's Backpack aims to deliver an intuitive yet interesting mod, which goes beyond the main inventory of the Vanilla game, allowing the player to carry more items that what they would normally be able to.
Adding 36 more inventory slots for each backpack, Ship's Backpack reprises the fluid tank and the embedded crafting table mechanics that were well-known within Adventure Backpack, thus making it an extremely versatile mod for each and every player that wants to enjoy a non-game breaking experience while still overcoming some of the main game's limitations.

With more that 100 backpacks to choose from, one may wonder whether the mod becomes boring after a while. The not so obvious answer can be found in another one of the main features of this mod: abilities.
Many backpacks are not be obtainable by common crafting and require the player to venture in another dimension or perform specific actions in-game. Every single one of them is described via tooltips containing info about special backpacks, but if you seek to make your life harder, look no further: those tooltips can be disabled server side, leaving the users with no other choice but to experiment and try to collect them all.

But what exactly are abilities?
They have a wide range of actions, from a simple trail of particles to very powerful effects, and some backpacks will even be able to transform into others.
Maybe you'll find a useful backpack that will let you see in the dark, or perhaps one that will let you swim in lava without taking damage. All effects are further described in the wiki.
